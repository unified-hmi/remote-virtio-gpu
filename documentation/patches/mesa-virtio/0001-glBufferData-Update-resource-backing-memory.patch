Subject: [PATCH] glBufferData: Update resource backing memory.

Update buffer backing memory on buffer initialization with data.
This is workaround for UHMI project, where
VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_TRANSFER_FROM_HOST_3D command is not implemented.

The problem is in the following use-case:
1) glBufferData --- reserves guest memory "backing" for resource,
but doesn't fill it with data. Instead, data is serialized into
virgl internal command and sent using VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_SUBMIT_3D
comand. This command is opaque for rvgpu-proxy/rvgpu-renderer and serialized cmd buffer
is just forwarded to virglrenderer, where it is deserialized and
used for initialization of internal "gpu" memory with this data.
2) glMapBuffer --- this calls TRANSFER_FROM_HOST_3D, which asks host/rvgpu-proxy-->
rvgpu-renderer/virglrenderer to update backing memory (on source) with buffer data.
And further this backing memory is mapped to guest application.
In case of UHMI, TRANSFER_FROM_HOST_3D is not implemented, thus the memory is
not "initialized".
3) Modify buffer memory, but not whole memory, just some chunks.
4) glUnmapBuffer --- this will trigger VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_TRANSFER_TO_HOST_3D
command, which will send to target whole buffer memory and will overwrite
previous memory. It's ok for modified in step 3 memory, but other is
just garbage (I always saw zero filled memory).

The above scenario produces artifacts on buffer-scene of glmark, in case of
"update-method=map", which forces glmark to use 1-4 flow.

As a workaround, fill buffer backing memory with data on step 1.
